<h1> Website Review </h1>

<h2> <a href="https://helena.craigslist.org/">Craigslist  </a></h2>
<p> Craigslist is a bad website because it first is very messy.
Everything is just stacked on top of each other with tons and tons of lists with really no order.
The font of the website and the color are all the same which makes it seem almost none professional
along with very small font which is hard to see. It has no menus and no sort of design.
This website seems like they used very little of the css ascpect as far making things pleasing to the eye. As soon as you look at the website their is so much information thrown at you, you don't know where to look.
The code seems very simple and not much work put into it. The website is full of random collums that are confusing.
 For someone looking for something specific and hadnt used the website before it would be difficult to find what they are looking for quickly </p>
<p> All in all for this website to be used as much as it does and honestly has a very good purpose, the design and layout of the website is very poor and could be made a lot better.</p>


<h2> <a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify design</a></h2>
<p>I really like this website because it is organized and very well. The website has a lot of time and effort put into it. The colors as you scoll down are very nice.
the menus on the website are easy to use and you can find what your looking for. Spotify is very common and gets used by professionals along with the common users so the website should be very well done and be able to be used to the top artists in thw world.
You can tell that the website wants to help you. The code of the website is very sophisticated and you can tell thier was a lot of time put into creating it.
The collums are sections in the website are very well put together. The website has little actions that show up as you scoll down that are super cool also. It isnt super long which I like because I hate scolling
downsuper far to try and find what I'm looking for. </p>
<p> I really like this website because it is pleasing to eye and is very well put together to help you find what your looking for.</p>

<h2> <a href="https://www.simplychocolate.com/"> Simply Chocolate</a></h2>
<p> This Website has lots of menus to help you find what your looking for instantly but it dosent have to much to where it gets crammed.
It also has a search bar in the website so if you dont find what your finding in the menus you can just search it in the seach bar. The website does have a lot of information presented at the start but I dont think it is to much to the
point where you notice it being super crammed. The websit keeps you interested by loads of different variations of thier product which is a plus considering they are trying to sell you something.
The website has pictures of their products that get you hungry just by looking at them which is obviously what they want.The layout it very
good and fits what its purpose as getting your attention and also using sort of a friendly light to present thier products which I think is very important. </p>
<p> I thought this was a great website because its a perfect layout for selling chocolates and has a very family friendly vibe to it. It is very easy to navigate and you can easily find what you are looking for.</p>
